## DUMP and DUMPX command

**Note:** Prior to Version 7.5 of Model 204, the command processing described below is available only to Sirius Mods customers.

The DUMP command works exactly like the standard Model 204 DUMP command, with the exception that at Fast/Backup authorized sites, DUMP invokes Fast/Backup rather than the standard Model 204 dump processing. If for some reason a Fast/Backup site wants to use the standard Model 204 DUMP command processing (most likely for diagnosing a problem with Fast/Backup), a DUMPX command can be issued. The DUMPX command has syntax identical to the DUMP command.
