## Classes and Objects

Classes

A class in Rocket is a collection that describes the characteristics of a type of object. The collection of variables and methods that make up a class is called the class's interface.  Objects are instances of a class.  The attributes of an object are the values of the variables of the class.  The methods of an object are the functions of the class.

Class Block Syntax

The full syntax for a class block is:

```
class <class_name> {
    <variable_declarations>
    <method_declarations>
}
```

Function Syntax

Variables that have a class as their type are called class variables.  Class variables are declared using the `class` keyword.

Class Members

Class members are the variables and methods that belong to a class.

Class Name

The class name is a user-defined identifier that is used to refer to the class.

Data Members

Data members are the variables that belong to a class.

Methods

Methods are the functions that belong to a class.

Method Declarations

Method declarations specify the name, parameters, and return type of a method.

Method Types

*   **Instance Methods:** Instance methods are methods that operate on an object of a class.
*   **Static Methods:** Static methods are methods that operate on a class itself, not on an object of the class.

Method Parameters

Method parameters are the values that are passed to a method when it is called.

Method Return Types

Method return types specify the type of value that a method returns.

Class Variables

Class variables are variables that belong to a class, not to an object of the class.

Object Variables

Object variables are variables that belong to an object of a class.

Class Inheritance

Class inheritance is a mechanism by which a class can inherit the properties of another class.

Class Polymorphism

Class polymorphism is a mechanism by which a class can have multiple forms.

Class Encapsulation

Class encapsulation is a mechanism by which the internal workings of a class are hidden from the outside world.

Class Abstraction

Class abstraction is a mechanism by which the complexity of a class is hidden from the outside world.

Class Design

Class design is the process of creating classes.

Class Examples

```
class Point {
    x: int;
    y: int;
}
```

Class Usage

```
var p: Point;
p = new Point();
p.x = 10;
p.y = 20;
```

Class Libraries

Class libraries are collections of classes that can be used to create applications.

Class Diagrams

Class diagrams are diagrams that show the relationships between classes.

Class Relationships

*   **Inheritance:** A class inherits properties from another class.
*   **Aggregation:** A class contains other classes.
*   **Composition:** A class is composed of other classes.

Class Design Principles

*   **Encapsulation:** Hide internal details of a class.
*   **Abstraction:** Simplify complex details.
*   **Inheritance:** Reuse existing code.
*   **Polymorphism:** Allow objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type.

Class Design Patterns

*   **Singleton:** Create only one instance of a class.
*   **Factory:** Create objects without specifying their concrete classes.
*   **Observer:** Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Class Naming Conventions

Class names should be nouns or noun phrases.  They should be capitalized.

Class Access Modifiers

*   **Public:** Accessible from anywhere.
*   **Private:** Accessible only within the class.
*   **Protected:** Accessible within the class and subclasses.

Class Methods

Methods are functions that operate on objects of a class.

Class Variables

Class variables are variables that belong to a class, not to an object of the class.

Class Constructors

Constructors are special methods that are called when an object of a class is created.

Class Destructors

Destructors are special methods that are called when an object of a class is destroyed.

Class Operators

Operators are special symbols that can be used to perform operations on objects of a class.
