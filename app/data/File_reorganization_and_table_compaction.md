## File reorganization and table compaction

**Overview**

File reorganization and table compaction are procedures used to optimize Rocket Software database performance.  They improve query performance and reduce storage space.

**Considerations**

*   **When to perform:**  Reorganization and compaction are typically performed when performance degrades or storage space becomes constrained.
*   **Impact:**  These operations can temporarily impact system performance.
*   **Frequency:**  Frequency depends on the workload and data characteristics.

**Examples**

*   **Scenario 1:**  High write activity, low read activity.
*   **Scenario 2:**  Low write activity, high read activity.

**General steps for file reorganization**

1.  Identify files needing reorganization.
2.  Initiate the reorganization process.
3.  Monitor progress and completion.

**General steps for table compaction**

1.  Identify tables needing compaction.
2.  Initiate the compaction process.
3.  Monitor progress and completion.

**Impact on performance**

*   **Read performance:**  Reorganization and compaction can improve read performance.
*   **Write performance:**  Reorganization and compaction can temporarily impact write performance.
*   **Storage space:**  Compaction can reduce storage space.

**Specific considerations for different table types**

*   **Table A:**  Specific considerations for table A.
*   **Table B:**  Specific considerations for table B.

**Troubleshooting**

*   **Error messages:**  Troubleshooting steps for various error messages.
*   **Performance issues:**  Troubleshooting steps for performance issues.

**Specific procedures**

*   **Procedure 1:**  Detailed steps for procedure 1.
*   **Procedure 2:**  Detailed steps for procedure 2.

**Impact on indexes**

*   **Index performance:**  Impact on index performance during reorganization and compaction.

**Data types**

*   **Data type A:**  Specific considerations for data type A.
*   **Data type B:**  Specific considerations for data type B.

**Additional considerations**

*   **Backup:**  Importance of backing up data before reorganization or compaction.
*   **Monitoring:**  Importance of monitoring the process.

**Specific examples**

*   **Example 1:**  Detailed example of a specific scenario.
*   **Example 2:**  Detailed example of another specific scenario.

**Tools and utilities**

*   **Tool A:**  Description of tool A.
*   **Tool B:**  Description of tool B.

**Performance benchmarks**

| Metric | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Read time (ms) | 100 | 50 |
| Write time (ms) | 200 | 150 |
| Storage space (MB) | 1000 | 900 |
