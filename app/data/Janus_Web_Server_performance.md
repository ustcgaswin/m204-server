## Janus Web Server performance

**Janus Web Server and APSY subsystems**

Janus Web Server makes it easy to "turn on" and "turn off" applications. It is simple every time a Janus Web Server role is set in a URL associated with a web application processing, unfortunately, any included procedures are complicated especially if involved.  Model 204 compiled applications with no explicit settings.

**Overload of implementing APSY subsystems**

The first factor is how APSY modules are internal physical operating systems.  Formed files and groups are generally small, but for the most, the overload is in the subsystems.  These might cause issues in the subsystem.

**Avoiding APSY login procedures**

By avoiding the login procedure, the performance of the application is improved.  This is because the login procedure involves a lot of overhead.

**Janus Web Server audit trail**

The comprehensive and well-associated Janus Web Server logs details on the Model 204 audit trail journal relative to the demands of a comparable enterprise.

**Janus Web Server and RACF validation**

Janus Web Server is designed to be RACF-compliant.  The RACF login allows users to log on to web pages on any system.  High calls and validations may cause performance issues.

**Janus Web Server and Chunked encoding**

As of version 7.6, Janus Web Server handles chunked HTTP requests.

**Keep-Alive support**

Janus Web Server can handle the Keep-Alive support.

**Janus Web Server and MP/204**

Two of the biggest exceptions for MP/204 environment are the handling of (and avoiding) subsystems.  No read-only capability and removing conflicts.

**SIRIUS PRINT statement syntax**

The SIRIUS PRINT statement is a compiled directive.  It does not readily execute.
