## Allocating and directing files dynamically

**Overview**

You can allocate files in a flexible way using the `File` command.  The page explains the following commands:

*   `FILE`
*   `FREE`
*   `ALLOCATE`

Examples are provided, showing how to use these commands.

**Dynamic file allocation**

A device can allocate files dynamically in the following ways:

*   `FILE` command with `ALLOCATE` option
*   `FILE` command with `FREE` option
*   `FILE` command with `COPY` option
*   `FILE` command with `DELETE` option
*   `FILE` command with `UPDATE` option
*   `FILE` command with `REPLACE` option
*   `FILE` command with `MOVE` option

The procedure for dynamic file allocation is detailed.

**DEFINE DATASET parameters**

The relevant parameters for defining datasets are described.

**JOPS considerations**

The considerations for JOPS are explained.

**LARGE DATA SEGMENTS**

Large data segments are supported.

**FILE ALLOCATION**

The `FILE` command is used for file allocation.

**ALLOCATE and FREE commands considerations**

When allocating dynamically, the following factors are important:

*   The allocation number
*   The volume number
*   The device number
*   The file name
*   The file size
*   The file type
*   The file attributes
