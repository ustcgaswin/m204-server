## Global features

### Global features overview

*   Global features are attributes that are applicable to the entire application.
*   They are defined in a global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the application.
*   Global features can be used to customize the application's behavior, appearance, and functionality.

### Global variables

*   Global variables are variables that are declared outside of any function.
*   They are accessible from anywhere in the program.
*   Global variables can be used to store data that needs to be accessed by multiple parts of the program.

### Global functions

*   Global functions are functions that are declared outside of any class or module.
*   They are accessible from anywhere in the program.
*   Global functions can be used to perform operations that need to be accessed by multiple parts of the program.

### Global data structures

*   Global data structures are data structures that are declared outside of any function.
*   They are accessible from anywhere in the program.
*   Global data structures can be used to store data that needs to be accessed by multiple parts of the program.

### Global constants

*   Global constants are constants that are declared outside of any function.
*   They are accessible from anywhere in the program.
*   Global constants can be used to store values that should not be changed.

### Global images and graphics

*   Global images and graphics are images and graphics that are loaded once and used throughout the application.
*   They can be accessed from anywhere in the application.
*   Global images and graphics can be used to improve the application's performance.

### Global settings

*   Global settings are settings that are applied to the entire application.
*   They can be accessed and modified from anywhere in the application.
*   Global settings can be used to customize the application's behavior, appearance, and functionality.

### Global resources

*   Global resources are resources that are loaded once and used throughout the application.
*   They can be accessed from anywhere in the application.
*   Global resources can be used to improve the application's performance.

### Global features and their benefits

*   Improved code organization
*   Reduced code duplication
*   Increased maintainability
*   Enhanced reusability
*   Improved performance

### Global features and their drawbacks

*   Potential for unintended side effects
*   Increased complexity
*   Potential for naming conflicts
*   Potential for security vulnerabilities

### Global feature examples

### Global feature best practices

*   Use global features sparingly.
*   Use descriptive names for global features.
*   Document global features clearly.
*   Test global features thoroughly.
*   Avoid using global features for tasks that can be performed locally.

### Global feature implementation

*   Declare global features outside of any function.
*   Use appropriate access modifiers (e.g., public, private).
*   Initialize global features appropriately.
*   Use global features consistently.

### Global feature design considerations
