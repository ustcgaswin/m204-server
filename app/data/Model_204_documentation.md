## Model 204 documentation

Rocket Model 204 documentation has been converted from individual manuals in PDF format to a set of cross-linked HTML articles in this integrated wiki, M204wiki.  The very few documents that remain in PDF are accessible from M204wiki. This page specifies which manuals have been converted to M204wiki pages and which manuals remain in PDF format. The page is divided into a section for the "standard" Model 204 document set prior to version 7.5 and a section for the "added-on" Sirius products.
