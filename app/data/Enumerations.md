## Enumerations

**Enumerations**

Object properties that can be explicitly assigned values.  You may see these values as a list of choices.  For example, in a `Car` object, you might have an enumeration for `Color` with values like `Red`, `Blue`, `Green`.

**Declaring enumeration variables**

Enumeration variables are any number of variables.  The most common enumeration variable is a `switch` statement.

**Using enumerations**

You can use enumerations to control the flow of your application.  For example, you can use an enumeration to determine which action to take based on the value of a variable.

**Enumeration methods**

*   **`toString()`**: Returns a string representation of the enumeration.
*   **`valueOf()`**: Returns the enumeration value for a given string.
*   **`values()`**: Returns an array of all enumeration values.

**Common enumeration variables**

*   `Empty`
*   `Error`
*   `Success`
*   `Pending`
*   `Running`
*   `Stopped`

**Using enumeration variables**

*   **Set 1**: `x` = `red`, `y` = `blue`
*   **Set 2**: `x` = `green`, `y` = `yellow`
*   **Set 3**: `x` = `orange`, `y` = `purple`

**Coding following property**

*   `Angle`
*   `Color`
*   `Size`
*   `Shape`
*   `Material`
*   `Type`
*   `Value`
*   `Result`

**Storing enumerations**

Enumerations can be stored in a variety of ways, depending on the programming language.  In some languages, enumerations are stored as integers.  In others, they are stored as strings.

**User enumerations**

When dealing with user-defined enumerations, it is important to consider the data types and values that will be used.  This is crucial for ensuring that the enumeration is used correctly and that the data is handled appropriately.

**The Enumeration Block**

The enumeration block can contain multiple values, such as `value1`, `value2`, `value3`.  Each value can have an associated integer or string value.

**Using your enumerations**

You can use enumerations to control the flow of your application.  For example, you can use an enumeration to determine which action to take based on the value of a variable.

**Enumeration methods**

*   `toString()`
*   `valueOf()`
*   `values()`

**Coding following property**

*   `Angle`
*   `Color`
*   `Size`
*   `Shape`
*   `Material`
*   `Type`
*   `Value`
*   `Result`

**Additional property**

*   `Status`
