## SirMon date processing

The only use of dates within SirMon is to examine the CPU clock (as returned by the STCK hardware instruction) to determine the current date, in case SirMon is under a rental or trial agreement. Other than that, there are no date processing considerations for using SirMon. SirMon itself does not produce any results that depend on the content of any data that may be date values.

For headers on pages or rows that occur on printed pages or displayed screens, RKTools products generally use a full four-digit year format, although they may display dates with two-digit years in circumstances where the proper century can be inferred from the context.
