## SirMon

SirMon is a comprehensive facility for monitoring the performance and availability of Model 204 Online systems. It is part of the RKTools family of products.  As of Model 204 V7.5, the functions and facilities necessary to run RKTools are built into the Model 204 kernel. Earlier versions require the installation of Sirius Mods.

### SirMon overview

SirMon combines real-time monitoring with intelligent full-screen (TN3270 or browser) displays for System Manager duties. Displays can be scrolled and sorted.  It supports automatic refresh for timed operations.  Features highlight resource consumers, restrict displays, and prevent checkpoints to identify problems.  Users can be bumped or have priorities reset, and subsystems can be stopped/started.  SirMon is integrated with the Model 204 security scheme.  It also provides a background monitor that measures system statistics against user-defined thresholds, sending warnings on problems.

SirMon divides Model 204 Online into System, Subsystem, File, User, and Task statistics.  It provides additional statistics for understanding performance.  Online Help explains statistics.  SirMon is distributed with pre-defined screens for each display category, ranging from general overviews to specific views.  Information is tailored to the current screen.  An integrated "fastpath" command structure or browser menu allows fast navigation.  Pre-defined monitoring options are useful for analysis and problem-solving.  Extensive customization facilities allow for designing and implementing custom displays, fully integrated with SirMon (TN3270 or RKWeb).  Support for display sorting, standard prefix commands, fastpath access, and automatically generated Help text is included.
