## Object oriented programming in SOUL

In version 7.5 of Model 204, User Language became SOUL, and SOUL was enhanced to include Object-Oriented Programming (sometimes abbreviated OOP) concepts.

**Object-oriented terminology**

* **Class:** A description of the information held in a particular type of object and the methods (actions) that can be performed on the object. There may be many instances of objects for any given class.
* **Collection:** A special class used to manage collections or groups of variables.  A collection provides the same functionality as an array, though with more flexibility.
* **Constructor:** A method that processes an object immediately after the object is instantiated (created).
* **Discard:** A method that removes an existing object explicitly.
* **Enumeration:** A special class used to denote a group of names with a limited set of values.
* **Exception:** A class used to describe an error situation detected during method execution.
* **Function:** A method that returns a value and cannot be set.
* **Intrinsic method:** A method applied to a string or number, providing object-oriented syntax benefits.
* **Instantiation:** The process of creating an object, an instance of a class.
* **Member:** A method or variable in a class.
* **Method:** A block of code performing a particular operation in a class.  Methods can be shared or non-shared.
* **Object:** A collection of information describing an entity (e.g., customer, order). Objects have state that can change over time.
* **Method object:** In a SOUL statement, the object variable referencing the object on which the method operates.
* **Property:** A method reflecting the state of an object or class. Properties can be read-only or settable.
* **Structure:** A standard layout of variables.  A structure is similar to an image, except a structure can have many instances.
* **Subroutine:** A method that does not return a value.
* **Variable:** A container for a value.  SOUL OOP provides class variables that can be shared or non-shared.
