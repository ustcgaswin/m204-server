## SIS Gradebook

**Overview**

SIS Gradebook, integrated with the rest of SIS, allows teachers to enter student scores for course work and to calculate marking period marks and a final average for submission to the marking system. SIS Gradebook is based on the concept of a web application, for two-level requirements.

* **The Gradebook Layout:**
    * The layout contains the elements of a course that students are scored on, and shows how those scores are used to determine the student's marking period mark and final average. The course elements are organized into categories, such as assignments, tests, quizzes, and projects.  These categories can be further broken down into subcategories.  The categories are typically organized by subject, and the subcategories are organized by specific assignments, tests, quizzes, or projects.  The categories and subcategories are often specific to the state, such as those for Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia.  Possibly teachers won't go beyond the categories assigned by the system.
    * The scores for a course that the teacher needs to record for the specified marking period.  Since the SIS gradebook is integrated with the other parts of the system, the scores are automatically calculated and displayed in the gradebook.
    * The gradebook is designed to facilitate the recording of scores for each student in a course.  The scores are entered in the gradebook, and the system automatically calculates the student's marking period mark and final average.
    * Each marking period has its own calculation for each student, and the final average is calculated based on the scores entered for each marking period.
    * Different marking periods might also contain weighted marks, though this would probably be a very unusual and probably not done.
    * The gradebook allows teachers to enter scores for each assignment or test, and the system automatically calculates the student's final average.
    * Teachers can also enter additional information such as comments or feedback.
    * Administrators have a read-only view of the gradebook for any student.

* **Features:**
    * Teachers can build a grading scheme from scratch, or use a provided template or copy from other sections or a previous year.  How grades are calculated is a function of the grading scheme.
    * **Display:**
        * Grades, for each student, in each assignment, for each teacher.
        * Additional information, such as comments, can be added to the individual student's records.
        * The system is restricted to a single category and its subcategories.
        * The layout can be customized to fit the needs of the teacher.
