The XmlDoc API is one of the core APIs documented in Rocket Software's XML processing and web services. XmlDoc documents follow a model that can be used by XML processing tools.  Documents are organized into categories and use standard XML structures. They form a branch of a document, which is a tree-like structure.  This document is used when Rocket Software's XML API is connected to a client application.

**Structure**

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| **Resource** | Describes the intended use of documents and how to convert them.  Items represent the internet of the XML documents. |
| **Attributes** | Captures values in XML, such as adding, deleting, or replacing values. |
| **Load** | Loads XML in a webview or other display, working with complex structures. |
| **Content** | Contains instructions and representations and transactions. |
| **Other** | These are other descriptions not directly related to internal operations, example: structure, operations, and debugging facilities. |
