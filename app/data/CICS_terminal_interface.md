## CICS terminal interface

**Overview**

CICS is compatible with Model 204 terminals.  Using the CICS interface introduces changes to the usual impression and mode of operation of a CICS-owned terminal. These changes vary depending on the terminal type.

**Terminals supported**

*   CICS supports the specific operation parameters for the CICS interface and user session.
*   Rank of these and compatible terminals.
*   IBM 3270 and Teletype terminals.

**Host language applications**

Selection of terminal support mode

*   Two modes of terminal support are available:
    *   Model 204 users IBM 3270 terminals: full screen and line at a time. Full screen terminals allow the entire screen to be formatted and displayed as a single line while at a time terminals print input and output in lines.
    *   To determine the mode, refer to the installation system manager manual.

**Additional print capabilities**

Invoking and disconnecting from the CICS interface
